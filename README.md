# Data-Engineering-Piramal

Report containg the data engineering internship at Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Ltd. 

Our project in the data engineering team was to create and execute AWS Glue scripts to generate new tables in the Snowflake database required for ORD visualizations. Thus, new tables were added to both UAT (used primarily for testing purposes) and PROD environments (mainly for production purposes) in the Snowflake database.
